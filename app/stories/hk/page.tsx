      <h2 className="text-3xl mt-12">Part I: H</h2>

      <h3>Victory and Perception</h3>
      <p>
        H's eyebrow carries a faint line left by a cricket ball during a school match.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "The ball hit the side of my face, but I managed to catch it."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The injury came with victory, and that context mattered.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "People said it looked cool, like an anime scar."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        He recalled. Friends praised it. His mother, however, saw something else.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "She said I looked like a rogue, not a gentleman."
      </blockquote>

      <h3>The Changing Gaze</h3>
      <p>
        This split reaction captures how scars on men can oscillate between <Highlight>stigma and strength</Highlight> depending on who's looking. Among peers, the scar became a badge of toughness. Among older family members, it signaled recklessness, even delinquency.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "Whenever I would act out, they'd be like, 'Yeah, you fit this scar. You look like a gangster.'"
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        H explained. The mark itself never changed. Only the <Highlight>gaze</Highlight> did.
      </p>

      <h3>Masculinity Codes</h3>
      <p>
        What I find revealing here is how much scars on men get read through <Highlight>masculinity codes</Highlight>. When a scar aligns with ideals of toughness or bravery, it becomes appealing, even enviable. But when read through conservative or parental lenses, the same mark can become rebellion or carelessness. H learned to navigate this:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "You have to be proud of your flaws, no matter what they are."
      </blockquote>

      <h3>The Limits of Pride</h3>
      <p>
        Yet pride isn't always enough. H also described how strangers in public would automatically assume he was the troublemaker in any situation.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "People would look at me like, 'Oh, you're the one who caused this problem,' even though I did nothing."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The scar made him visible in ways he didn't control. His story shows how <Highlight>self-confidence can rewrite perception</Highlight>, but it also shows the limits: you can claim your scar, but you can't always control what others project onto it.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl mt-12">Part II: K</h2>

      <h3>The Quiet Story</h3>
      <p>
        K's face tells a quieter story. Not one dramatic injury, but years of acne and the scars left behind.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "No matter what I tried, it kind of didn't go away."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        He said. Unlike H, whose scar was praised, K's drew subtle disapproval, especially from family.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "My mom said I wasn't taking care of it properly."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        These words, repeated through adolescence, attached <Highlight>moral weight</Highlight> to a natural condition.
      </p>

      <h3>Moralized Marks</h3>
      <p>
        The difference between H's scar and K's reveals a harsh truth: when scars are linked to <Highlight>hygiene or medical conditions</Highlight>, they're often moralized. They're seen as consequence rather than coincidence, failure rather than fate.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "Maybe people might think I'm not well kept or something like that."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        K reflected. The assumption wasn't explicit cruelty. It was ingrained: acne scars suggest carelessness, lack of discipline, poor maintenance.
      </p>

      <h3>From Shame to Structure</h3>
      <p>
        Yet from this pressure, something unexpected emerged.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "I started cleaning my face regularly, paying attention to what worked."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        He explained. The scars pushed him toward <Highlight>discipline and self-care</Highlight>. Over time, he understood they weren't failings but reminders of effort.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "The scars made me take better care of myself."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        What began as shame transformed into structure.
      </p>

      <h3>Managing with Grace</h3>
      <p>
        K's story complicates the narrative of scar acceptance. He didn't simply embrace his scars. He worked to minimize them while learning to live with what remained.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "It's more in my head than it is an actual problem."
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        He admitted, noting how friends claimed not to notice while his own awareness never faded. This tension, between <Highlight>internal scrutiny and external acceptance</Highlight>, defines many people's relationships with visible difference. His scars became maps of self-maintenance and maturity, proof that healing isn't always about embracing flaws. Sometimes it's about managing them with enough grace to move forward.
